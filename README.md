- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RobAAW. I prefer Aaron.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in C# and .NET, as this is my starting point for code. Currently expanding my knowledge base by diving into AWS, React and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reinforcing the fundamentals of CS core, and focusing on C# and .NET to strive to be excellent at one specific language/framework (for now). 
- ðŸŒ± I'll be expanding into JavaScript and React for front-end experience.
- ðŸ“« I can be reached at aaronward@proton.me.
